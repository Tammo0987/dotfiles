# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. It includes the following:

- i3
- picom
- rofi (copied from [https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/dotfiles))

## Installing

To install the dotfiles, the link.sh script could be used. It only links the configuration and does not install any packages.
